Cisco-Abbrev

Cisco routers often produce abbreviated interface names in terse command
output.  This module translates from the short name to the canonical
interface name, and vice versa.  For example:

	Fa3/1 --> FastEthernet3/1
	FastEthernet3/1 --> Fa3/1

This is useful for cross-referencing between router outputs that use both
formats.
